# wash
The Whatever Shell

This is my shell that I'm building for fun.

Currently features a lot of the basics you'd expect from a shell, like running commands, setting variables, and piping processes to one another.

You can write "scripts" for wash, but there isn't really a scripting language yet. What there is a facility to dynamically compile and load object files with specific entry points that Wash knows about.

Read the TODO to learn about what I'm working on. Read the source code (especially builtins.rs) to learn what you can currently do with wash.

Documentation, code optimization, usability, support for anything besides specifically 64-bit linux are all WIP.
